### Adding New Tips

We love new tips! To add a new tip:

1. Tips are stored in `/data/tips.json` and translated versions in `/data/locales/`
2. Each tip must have:
   - A unique numeric `id`
   - A `title`
   - `content` with useful information
   - OS-specific content when applicable (`windows`, `macos`, `linux`)
3. Follow the JSON schema defined in `/data/tips.schema.json`
4. Ensure the tip is helpful, accurate, and actionable

### Contributing Translations

We support 11 languages and welcome translation contributions:

- English (`en`)
- Chinese Mandarin (`zh`)
- Hindi (`hi`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- French (`fr`)
- Arabic (`ar`)
- Bengali (`bn`)
- Portuguese (`pt`)
- Russian (`ru`)
- Japanese (`ja`)
- Hebrew (`he`)

To contribute translations:

1. Translate tips in `/data/locales/<language-code>.json`
2. Update UI strings in `/src/localization.ts` if needed
3. Ensure all tips are translated for completeness
4. Maintain the same numeric `id` across all language files
5. Test your translations in VS Code with the language setting

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding guidelines

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   - Run `npm run lint` to check code style
   - Run `npm run check-types` to verify TypeScript
   - Run `npm test` if tests exist
   - Press `F5` to test the extension manually

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: describe what you added"
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: describe what you fixed"
   ```

### Submitting the Pull Request

1. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub from your fork to our `main` branch

3. **Fill in the PR template** (if available) with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Type of change (bug fix, new feature, translation, etc.)
   - Checklist of completed tasks

4. **Wait for review** - maintainers will review your PR and may request changes

5. **Make requested changes** if needed and push them to the same branch

### PR Review Criteria

Your PR should:
- âœ… Follow the coding standards (ESLint configuration)
- âœ… Include appropriate error handling
- âœ… Not break existing functionality
- âœ… Have clear, descriptive commit messages
- âœ… Include updated documentation if adding features
- âœ… Pass all lint and type checks

## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules defined in `eslint.config.mjs`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### ESLint Configuration

We use ESLint with TypeScript support. Key rules:
- Use semicolons
- Use strict equality (`===`)
- Use curly braces for all control structures
- Follow naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types/classes)

### Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation (consistent with existing code)
- Use double quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multiline objects/arrays
- Keep line length reasonable (under 120 characters when possible)

### Best Practices

- Write modular, reusable code
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks
- Sanitize user input and dynamic content (prevent XSS)
- Follow VS Code extension best practices
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Avoid breaking changes when possible

## Tips for Contributing

- **Start small** - Consider starting with documentation improvements, typo fixes, or small bug fixes
- **Ask questions** - If you're unsure about something, open an issue to discuss it
- **Be patient** - Maintainers may take time to review PRs
- **Be respectful** - We're all here to make this extension better
- **Check existing issues** - Someone might already be working on your idea
- **One PR per feature** - Keep PRs focused on a single change
